## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- How to apply light/dark theme using styled-components
- Use redux-toolkit for a better developer experience while using redux
- How to make and pass -- attributes in order to apply different styles when using styled-components
- How to set/get data to and from the browser's localStorage  

### Continued development

That bonus **drag&drop** feature would be a good challenge for this app. I might eventually add that feature.
